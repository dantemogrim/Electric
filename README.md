## About

Our web development class had a group assignment together with the computer graphics class from our school at Yrgo. <br>
Our job was to create a front-end landing page for a futuristic, fictional vehicle called 'The Light Cycle'.<br>
Computer graphics on the other hand had the assignment to recreate the vehicle through digital product visualization techniques.
<br><br>
The release of this fictitious vehicle was based off of a famous, French automotive manufacturer. The instructions were also vision based, wanting the result to: 'exude design, modernity, tech and innovation.'
